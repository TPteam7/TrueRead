# **Dyslexic Equation to Audio Project**


### **Problem statement**
The problem that we solved during this project is that dyslexic people struggle to understand difficult mathematical equations
    not because they can't solve them but they can' understand them.

It is able to help those who can complete the mathematical equations but can't understand them by looking at them.

This is important to address as the current situation is that wonderful minds can't enter tough mathematical careers due to a
    disability.

### **Algorithm of the solution**
We knew at the start that we would need to use some version of computer vision that would be able to understand equations.

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to 
    teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images.

We began looking at different API's or packages that would be able to implement this.

We stumbled across two sites. One is called MathPix and the other was a GitHub that was for OCR and would convert 
    an equation to latex form.

We ended up using MathPix as it was able to not only do pictures from online but also pictures of a whiteboard for example.
    It costs 2 cents for every run.

### **Analysis of the findings**
The analysis of our findings is that this program is able to deal with equations commonly seen during GCU programs.

It was fed many different types of equations such as derivatives, quadratics, and other commonly seen linear algebra and calculus topics.

We know that nothing can ever be 100% perfect but our program seems to run pictures that are not blurry and easy to read with little 
    to no error.

This code could be used to expand on for a Capstone or used for starter code for a solution to our problem statement.
